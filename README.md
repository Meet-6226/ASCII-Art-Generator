# ASCII-Art-Generator

Description 

This Python project is an ASCII Art Generator built with Tkinter. It allows users to create stylized ASCII text using the pyfiglet library and customize it with different fonts, colors, and themes. Users can preview the ASCII output in real time and save it as a TXT or PNG file. The interface includes theme switching (light/dark), dynamic text color selection, and a scrollable output window. It also supports exporting ASCII art as an image using PIL (Pillow).

The required libraries for this project are:

	1.	tkinter – For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
	2.	filedialog, ttk, scrolledtext, messagebox (from tkinter) – For file selection, UI styling, 
 		text scrolling, and message pop-ups.
	3.	pyfiglet – For generating ASCII art from text.
	4.	termcolor – For adding colors to ASCII text in the terminal.
	5.	PIL (Pillow) – For saving ASCII art as an image (PNG format).
