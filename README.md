# ASCII-Art-Generator

##Description 
This Python project is an ASCII Art Generator built with Tkinter. It allows users to create stylized ASCII text using the pyfiglet library and customize it with different fonts, colors, and themes. Users can preview the ASCII output in real time and save it as a TXT or PNG file. The interface includes theme switching (light/dark), dynamic text color selection, and a scrollable output window. It also supports exporting ASCII art as an image using PIL (Pillow).
