# ASCII-Art-Generator

Description 

This Python project is an ASCII Art Generator built with Tkinter. It allows users to create stylized ASCII text using the pyfiglet library and customize it with different fonts, colors, and themes. Users can preview the ASCII output in real time and save it as a TXT or PNG file. The interface includes theme switching (light/dark), dynamic text color selection, and a scrollable output window. It also supports exporting ASCII art as an image using PIL (Pillow).

The required libraries for this project are:

	1.	tkinter – For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
	2.	filedialog, ttk, scrolledtext, messagebox (from tkinter) – For file selection, UI styling, 
 		text scrolling, and message pop-ups.
	3.	pyfiglet – For generating ASCII art from text.
	4.	termcolor – For adding colors to ASCII text in the terminal.
	5.	PIL (Pillow) – For saving ASCII art as an image (PNG format).

Unique Features of the ASCII Art Generator Project:

	1.	Real-Time ASCII Preview – Updates the ASCII art dynamically as the user types or changes settings.
	2.	Light & Dark Themes – Allows users to switch between dark and light themes for a better user experience.
	3.	Save as TXT & PNG – ASCII art can be exported as a text file or an image (PNG format) using PIL (Pillow).
	4.	Scrollable Output Window – Provides a scrollable text box for displaying large ASCII art easily.
	5.	Dynamic GUI with Tkinter – Uses Tkinter’s ttk styling for a modern and clean interface.

Extra Features:

	Customizable Fonts & Colors – Users can select from multiple pyfiglet fonts and customize the text color.
